    <h4>Which is faster Bugatti or Lamborghini?</h4>
    <p>In the case of the Aventadorr vs. Chiroon, the answer is yes, in fact, much faster. One might assume the Aventador's weight would give it an edge on speed, but thats not the case.</p>
    <p>Acccording to bugatti-broward.com, "The Aventador reaches 60 mph from 0 mph in about 2.5 seconds, and reaches a top speed of about 217 mph. But, The Chironâ€™s uniquely powerful W16 engine enables it to charge from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds. It has a top speed of 304.77 miles per hour."</p>
